Spoiler Slayer includes out of the box support for many popular sites
including Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, Tumblr, YouTube, and Gizmodo; and it's
easy to add more.

Settings allow users to customize the blocking experience with 3 modes:
* Censor - Hides potential spoilers under a black censor bar
* Blur - Blurs out potential spoilers
* Remove - Removes spoilers completely from the page as if they were never there

Other features include:
* Imports, exports, and subscriptions - Create your list of spoilers or sites and share it with the world!
* Spoiler blur intensity - Blur spoilers to oblivion, or keep them just under legible
* Reveal on hover or click - Feeling brave? Spoiler Slayer can reveal
the spoiler when you hover over or click on the censored area
* RegEx support - Anticipate common misspellings of spoilers or only block certain URLs
* Selector helper - It's easy to add new sites with the built-in selector helper, which
highlights items on the page as you type
* Blocked counts - Know how many times you've avoided mild panic!
